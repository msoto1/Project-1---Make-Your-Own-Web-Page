            <div>
                <h3>How the Web Works</h3>
                        The web is a collection of user end devices, transport media, transport equipment and web servers. When an end user's device requests a web page it sends a HTTP request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the end user. Web browsing software installed on the device interprets the HTML code and displays it on the users screen.
                <h3>HTML Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
                        HTML is used by the majority of web pages to display text documents. Hypertext is used to describe what you see. Markup describes how the page looks.
                        &#60;HTML&#62; tag indicates that anything between it and a closing HTML tag is HTML code.
                        &#60;BODY&#62; indicates anything between the opening tag and closing tag should be displayed in the browser window.
                        &#60;HEAD&#62; element contains the title of the page indicating what the page is about.
                        &#60;TITLE&#62; will be displayed in the browser above where you type the URL.
                <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
                        HTML uses elements to describe the structure of the pages. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.Tags act like containers, they tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. 
                <h3>Why Computers are Stupid</h3>
                        Computers are generally considered stupid because they require instructions to perform a function. They will perform those instructions literally even if those instructions are incorrect. This is why even a small programming mistake can cause big problems.
                <h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
                        Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line i.e. &#60;img&#62;, &#60;em&#62;, and &#60;span&#62;.Block elements look like they start on a new line i.e. &#60;h1&#62; - &#60;h6&#62;, &#60;p&#62;, &#60;div&#62; tags.
            </div>   

            <h2>Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Developer Tools</h3>
                        HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an invisible box around the content inside of them. 
                <h3>HTML's "tree-like" Structure</h3>
                        HTML elements when grouped together in an HTML document form a tree like structure. Elements can contain other elements inside of them. When you look at the document in developer tools you can see this tree like structure that expands when you drill down deeper into the file structure.
                <h3>Indentations and Boxes</h3>
                        Following the flow of an HTML document you can look at the structure. The more indented the element tag is the more deeply the box is nested.
                <h3>Text Editors</h3>
                        Text editors are used to write code. Some text editors will even auto correct your code by adding a closing tag or automatically bring up a list of parameter suggestion.
            </div>
               

            <h2>Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Adding Style</h3>
                    CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. You can imagine every HTML element is surrounded by an invisible box. CSS allows you to specify background color, font, padding, etc.
                <h3>Understanding CSS</h3>
                    CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. This governs how the content of the specific element should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts a selector and a declaration. Within the declaration you have a property and a value.
                <h3>Thinking About Cascading</h3>
                    A simple web page should contain two documents an HTML file and a CSS file. HTML uses the link element to indicate where the CSS file is located i.e

            <div>
                <h3>Computers</h3>
                    Computers have a limited instruction set. They are dumb devices that only function when giving a specific intruction set. Programs tell computers how to function and what actions to perform. Like the lecture pointed out, computers can do almost anything computational as long as there is a program instructing it how to perform.
                <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
                    There are many different programming laugauges, but what they all have in commoning is a basic structured syntax. We have programming languages because if we wanted to tell a computer what to do in plain English it would be very verbious, and the instructions would have ambiguity. Programming languages are concise and it takes alot less wording or syntax to right an instruction.
                <h3>Iterpreters</h3> 
                    Interpreters are basically translators for the programming language that you have written. It takes a high level programming language and interprets it into something that the computer can understand. Python is a high level programming language that uses an interpreter to tell a computer or device what to do. 
            </div>
            <h2>Introduction to Variables and Strings</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Variables</h3>
                    Variables in Python are basically a container that is assigned a value. A vairiable can contain a numeric value or a character value such a string. A variable is assigned a value with the equal sign. We first declare a variriable such as: how_many_days, we then can assign a value to the declared variable i.e. 10 days by how_many_days=10; The difference between the equal sign in mathamatics is that in mathamatics it is the anwser it will not change and it can not be reused. The equal sign in Python assigns a variable a value to be displayed or reused and can change many times.
                <h3>Strings</h3>
                    Strings in Python are declared in either single or double quotation marks. In order to be valid the starting and ending quotations need to match. The .find command is a procedure in Python that allows you to search strings. You can enter parameters to narrow your search results. The difference between 2+2 and "2"+"2" is that one is a math problem and will give you 4, while the other in adding two string together which will give you 22.
            </div>

            <h2>Module 2: Work Session 2</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>What is a functions</h3>
                    A function is a block of usable code that performs an operation and returns a value. A function is defined by the keyword 'def' which is followed by operands. The basic syntax of a function is: def &#60;procedure&#62;(&#60;input&#62;&#60;input&#62;,...) To use a function you must call the procdure using the keyword and pass the expected number of inputs.
                <h3>Difference between Making and Using a Function</h3>
                    The between making and using a function is that when making a function you define the operation and the inputs required. After a funtion is defined and the required results are acceptable you can begin to use the function within a program. You use the function by calling the procedure and supplying the necessary data as iputs required for function to proceed.
                <h3>How do Functions Help to Avoid Repetition</h3> 
                    Functions help programmers avoid repetition by allowing code to be reused.You do not need to write the code over and over again everytime you need to perform a function. Code can be created in the form of a function and can be called within a program when needed. This way you only have to write the code once, and ofte times the function has already been written enabling you to no have to write it from scratch.
                <h3>What happens if a Function Does Not Have a Return Statement</h3>
                    When a function does not have a return statement the procedure does not return a value. Even though a function is called and the necessary input may be supplied the function will process the data. But if the return statement is not issued that data from the function will not be usable. No data will be outputted from that function.
            </div>
            <h2>Module 2: Work Session 3</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Equality Comparisons</h3>
                    Equality comparisons return a boolean value. True if comparison is correct and false if cmparison is not correct. Equality comparisons less than or greater than, equal or not equal, less than or equal to and greater than and equal to. 
                <h3>If Statements</h3>
                    If statements are composed of a test expression and a block of code that is implemented if the comparison is true.<br> General syntax is:<br>
                    if condition:<br>
                        indented statement block<br>
                    If statement is true do the indented program block, if false skip program statement. There are also if else statements that can test multiple test expressions, if one statement is not true it goes to the next if else statement and test the expression if it's true the program block will be implemented.
                <h3>While Loops</h3>
                    A while loop repeatedly implements the program statement as long as the condition is true. The while loop stops and proceeds to the next line of code when the while condition becomes false.
                    If the condition is untrue the first time it is tested the while loop will never run. On the other hand if the condition is always true and never false the program will run infinitely.
                    You can add a break statement if you want the program to stop. You can add a break in the while code to make the condition false and end the While Loop, moving to the next line of code.

                <h3>Structured Data</h3>
                    Python allows data to be structured in different ways. It really depends on what the data is and what kind of data operations will be performed. Python allows for lists to be created. List are very versatile and allow different types data to be contained within the elements. List indices start at zero and can be sliced, concatenated, and munipulated. They have a lot of similarities with strings but the data contained is mutable.
                <h3>Mutability</h3>
                    Mutable means that data can be change, immutable data cannot change it is a constant. List are mutable allowing for change this works well in the munipulation of the data. String object cannot be changed, lists can be changed.
                    Append will and the elements to the list. Adding list to an existing list will and the elments to the list in a element at the end of the list pointing to the new added elements to the list.

                    Google style guide for Python is a guide for the formatting of your code. It is a template that is used to make your code
                    more user friendly and readable. It outlines everything from indentation to how to name variables. The guide can be found at:<br>

                <h3>Defining __init__</h3>
                    A Python class is defined by the keyword class followed by the class name. Class names are usually capitalized, most classes will be inherited from other classes and define their own methods and attributes. The __init__ is called immediately after an instance of the class is created. The first argument of every class method is always named self. Self refers to the newly created object, you need to specify self when defining the method, but you do not specify it when calling the method.
                <h3>Keywords Stage 3</h3>
                    <img src="images/keyword_stage_3.png"/>
                <h3>Self</h3>
                    <i>Self</i> is how we refer to things in the class from within itself. <i>Self</i> is the first parameter in any function defined inside a class. Any function or variable created on the first level of indentation, that is lines of code that start one TAB to the right of where we put the class definition, is automatically put into <i>self</i>. To access these functions and variables elsewhere inside the class, their name must be preceeded with self and a full-stop i.e. self.variable_name.
                <h3>Class</h3>
                    You should consider a class like a blueprint, it isn't something in itself but describes how to make something. You make a class with the class operator in Python. A class can contain both data and Methods.
                <h3>Constructor</h3>
                    The constructor is always written as a function def __init__ . It must always take as its first argument a reference to the instance being created i.e <i> Self</i> .
                <h3>Instance Variable</h3>
                    Are always prefixed with the reserved word <i>self</i>. They are typically introduced and initialized in a constructor method named __init__. Instance variables are unique inside the object and outside the object.
                <h3>Instance Method</h3>
                    All function inside the class that have the argument self are instance methods.
                <h3>Instance</h3>
                    Can create multiple instances of a class and can get called multiple times. They are called instance variables and when they are called __init__ is used to initialize the variable and allocate memory space for the function.
                <h3>List and Arrays</h3>
                    List and arrays are basically the same in Python except Python doesn't use arrays it uses lists.To use an array you would have to install a array module for Python like numb.py. The major difference between a list and an array is that a list can hold different types of data while an array cannot.
                <h3>Predefined Variables</h3>
                    Classes have five predefined attributes:<br>
                    __dict__ the class name space<br>
                    __name__ the name of the class<br>
                    __bases__ the classes from which this class inherits<br>
                    __doc__ the class documentation string<br>
                    __module__ the name of the module in which the class was defined<br>
                <h3>Inheritance</h3>
                    Inheritance is another way to reuse code. We can create a class, and then use variables and functions from it in another class. We used inheritance to create our media and entertainment file in our example programs. We created the class module and created variables. The code was reusable and is a basic example of object oriented programming. The variables inherited their value as the function was called.<br>

                <h3>Python Modules</h3>
                    A Python module is a specialized dictionary that can store Python code so you can access it with the (.) operator. When you import a module there is only one for the entire program. To support this Python puts these definitions in a file and uses them in a script. They are then imported into the program to main or into another module. The module contains python definitions and statements and ends with the suffix .py appended to it.
                <h3>Library</h3>
                    Python comes with a built-in library of modules. These modules can be found under the Python Library Reference, which contains the module names, functions, and program attributes. The section covers the standard library that is distributed with Python and also includes information on optional module components that can be installed.
                <h3>Python Objects</h3>
                    Classes create objects or instances when the __init__ function is called. An example of an object is when we created the class turtle and imported the module .Turtle. <br>
                    <br>
                    brad = turtle.Turtle()
                    <br>
                    brad is the object from the file turtle when the class Turtle is called and () def __init__ function is called that creates memory space for the object brad.
                    You can think of a class as a medical form that you have to fill out at a doctors office. The form is always the same but the information varies by patient. The information submitted are instance variables or objects.
                <h3>Abstraction</h3>
                    HTML and CSS can be related to abstraction and OOP in that the relationship between the html file and css file is much like the relationship between a class and an object in Python. The HTML tags can be thought of as objects and the CSS file as the class functions creating the output of the objects. In a HTML file you have tags that format the way data is represented, instead of writting the same formatting over and over you can create a CSS file. The CSS file eliminates some of the repetition by acting upon those tags. For instance you could provide the overall look and feel of the webpage by using the body tag of an html document. The CSS file would contain a "function" that acts upon the body tag and outputs how that section should be displayed and what special formatting should be used inside the body tag. Abstraction in Python or any other program is used to make programs simpler. Take for example the module .Turtle or the program for our movie database tomatoes.py, this would be considered abstraction in programming because we can use the function but we do not have to write the program from scratch or know all the inner workings of the program but we can use it as a tool for a desired output. It hides the fine details but enables a programmer to understand the input(s) and output(s) of the function

                <h3>Reusing Methods</h3>
                    Methods or classes can be reused. Methods can also be used by a child class this is called method overriding. 
                <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
                    This allows pieces of code to be reused. As a programmer you can either build the function yourself or see if the function is already available. This reduces the time it takes to write a program and the complexity of a project. You can make changes to one class function without having to change all of your code. You can also add functions to your program without have to rewrite it. OOP allows for easier debugging because your code is modular in design making it simpler to read and enabling you to take a more structured systematic approach to debugging your code.

                <h3>Understanding Servers</h3>
                    Protocols define how data is formatted and sent over a network. It provides a set of rules on how to interpret the data from request, transmission, processing, and returning the the information. In this course one of the protocols we will be dealling with extensively is HTTP. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and it a protocol used to handle web requests. A simple example is the interaction between a web client and a web server. A client will send a "GET" request to a server passing along an object that is requested. The server will respond to the request and an web application will be initiated and the requested object returned to the client.
                <h3>Web URL's</h3>
                    A URL is made up of a protocol, host, and path. I.E. http://www.udacity.com/some_file.<br>
                    There are request that a server will use designated by /some_file?p=1 - the "?p=1" passes a parameter 'p' with the value of '1' to the server. This extra information that the server gets changes the entire URL sperate from the path.<br>
                    URL designated with /some_file#newpage is used to reference a page we are looking at, the '#' means a fragment does not get sent to the server.
                    URL's can also designate a port the is to be used for the requested service i.e. http://localhost:8000/
                    8000 would be the port and will always be between the host and the path.
                <h3>Server Queries</h3>
                    When we type a URL into the browser it setup a connection between the client and the server. The 'GET' request caontains a method 'GET', path 'some_file' and the protocol 'HTTP /1.1'. This request will be followed by the some headers from the client, like HOST and USER. A server will respond to a request with the protocol version, status code, and response phrase. Some of the status codes are: 200 - OK, 302 - FOUND, 404 - NOT FOUND, and 500 - SERVER ERROR. The servers main purpose is to respond to HTTP requests. It will either process static information such as a picture or dynamic response thats processed by a web application at the time of the client request.
                <h3>Validation</h3>
                    Validation is usually implemented on the server side to validate the inputted data is what is expected. When writting an application you want to prevent unwanted data reaching your server in a object request. This could be junk data or it could be used to exploit a security flaw in your validation. One way to prevent bad data is to verify the users inputted data, if it's correct procede with the application, but if it is incorrect render the form again and tell the user that the data enter was incorrect. There is also another way to prevent bad data and that is with the escape function. When escape is set to auto entries will be omitted if they are formatted HTML text. This prevents entries from being rendered by the browser and affecting your web page.
                <h3>HTML templates and Abstraction</h3>
                    HTML templates are important because it makes updating and changing HTML files easier. Templates allow you to reuse a base HTML document and sperates the base HTML and the content that is usually updated quite often. It also take the redundancy out of creating a website you can update a single HTML document or through templates update multiple files quickly and easier than if you had to do each one seperate. It allows you to use seperate your code an example would be project 4 that uses a seperate python file, html files, and yaml file. It also make your code more readable and simpler are far more secure.
