         How the Web Works

    <div class="concept-description">
    The web is a collection of user end devices, transport media, transport equipment and web servers. When an end user's device requests a web page it sends a HTTP request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the end user. Web browsing software installed on the device interprets the HTML code and displays it on the users screen.

    HTML is used by the majority of web pages to display text documents. Hypertext is used to describe what you see. Markup describes how the page looks.
                        &#60;HTML&#62; tag indicates that anything between it and a closing HTML tag is HTML code.
                        &#60;BODY&#62; indicates anything between the opening tag and closing tag should be displayed in the browser window.
                        &#60;HEAD&#62; element contains the title of the page indicating what the page is about.
                        &#60;TITLE&#62; will be displayed in the browser above where you type the URL.

    There are many different programming laugauges, but what they all have in commoning is a basic structured syntax. We have programming languages because if we wanted to tell a computer what to do in plain English it would be very verbious, and the instructions would have ambiguity. Programming languages are concise and it takes alot less wording or syntax to right an instruction.

Python is a high level programming language that uses an interpreter to tell a computer or device what to do.

    Variables in Python are basically a container that is assigned a value. A vairiable can contain a numeric value or a character value such a string. A variable is assigned a value with the equal sign. We first declare a variriable such as: how_many_days, we then can assign a value to the declared variable i.e. 10 days by how_many_days=10; The difference between the equal sign in mathamatics is that in mathamatics it is the anwser it will not change and it can not be reused. The equal sign in Python assigns a variable a value to be displayed or reused and can change many times.

    Strings in Python are declared in either single or double quotation marks. In order to be valid the starting and ending quotations need to match. The .find command is a procedure in Python that allows you to search strings. You can enter parameters to narrow your search results. The difference between 2+2 and "2"+"2" is that one is a math problem and will give you 4, while the other in adding two string together which will give you 22.

    A function is a block of usable code that performs an operation and returns a value. A function is defined by the keyword 'def' which is followed by operands. The basic syntax of a function is: def &#60prcedure&#62(&#60input&#62,&#60input&#62, ...) To use a function you must call the procdure using the keyword and pass the expected number of inputs.

    The between making and using a function is that when making a function you define the operation and the inputs required. After a funtion is defined and the required results are acceptable you can begin to use the function within a program. You use the function by calling the procedure and supplying the necessary data as iputs required for function to proceed.

         How do Functions Help to Avoid Repetition

    Functions help programmers avoid repetition by allowing code to be reused.You do not need to write the code over and over again everytime you need to perform a function. Code can be created in the form of a function and can be called within a program when needed. This way you only have to write the code once, and ofte times the function has already been written enabling you to no have to write it from scratch.

    When a function does not have a return statement the procedure does not return a value. Even though a function is called and the necessary input may be supplied the function will process the data. But if the return statement is not issued that data from the function will not be usable. No data will be outputted from that function.

         While Loops

    A while loop repeatedly implements the program statement as long as the condition is true. The while loop stops and proceeds to the next line of code when the while condition becomes false.
                    If the condition is untrue the first time it is tested the while loop will never run. On the other hand if the condition is always true and never false the program will run infinitely.
                    You can add a break statement if you want the program to stop. You can add a break in the while code to make the condition false and end the While Loop, moving to the next line of code.

List are very versatile and allow different types data to be contained within the elements. List indices start at zero and can be sliced, concatenated, and munipulated. They have a lot of similarities with strings but the data contained is mutable.
