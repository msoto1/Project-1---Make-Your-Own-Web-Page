                <h2>Lesson 1: Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>How the Web Works</h3>
                        The web is a collection of user end devices, transport media, transport equipment and web servers. When an end user's device requests a web page it sends a HTTP request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the end user. Web browsing software installed on the device interprets the HTML code and displays it on the users screen.
                        <h3>HTML Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
                        HTML is used by the majority of web pages to display text documents. Hypertext is used to describe what you see. Markup describes how the page looks.
                        &#60;HTML&#62; tag indicates that anything between it and a closing HTML tag is HTML code.
                        &#60;BODY&#62; indicates anything between the opening tag and closing tag should be displayed in the browser window.
                        &#60;HEAD&#62; element contains the title of the page indicating what the page is about.
                        &#60;TITLE&#62; will be displayed in the browser above where you type the URL.
                        <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
                        HTML uses elements to describe the structure of the pages. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.Tags act like containers, they tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. 
                        <h3>Why Computers are Stupid</h3>
                        Computers are generally considered stupid because they require instructions to perform a function. They will perform those instructions literally even if those instructions are incorrect. This is why even a small programming mistake can cause big problems.
                        <h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
                        Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line i.e. &#60;img&#62;, &#60;em&#62;, and &#60;span&#62;.Block elements look like they start on a new line i.e. &#60;h1&#62; - &#60;h6&#62;, &#60;p&#62;, &#60;div&#62; tags.
                    </div>   

                <h2>Lesson 2 Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
                        <div>
                        <h3>Developer Tools</h3>
                        HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an invisible box around the content inside of them. 
                        <h3>HTML's "tree-like" Structure</h3>
                        HTML elements when grouped together in an HTML document form a tree like structure. Elements can contain other elements inside of them. When you look at the document in developer tools you can see this tree like structure that expands when you drill down deeper into the file structure.
                        <h3>Indentations and Boxes</h3>
                        Following the flow of an HTML document you can look at the structure. The more indented the element tag is the more deeply the box is nested.
                        <h3>Text Editors</h3>
                        Text editors are used to write code. Some text editors will even auto correct your code by adding a closing tag or automatically bring up a list of parameter suggestion.
                        </div>
               

                <h2>Lesson 3 Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
                            <div>
                    <h3>Adding Style</h3>
                    CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. You can imagine every HTML element is surrounded by an invisible box. CSS allows you to specify background color, font, padding, etc.
                    <h3>Understanding CSS</h3>
                    CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. This governs how the content of the specific element should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts a selector and a declaration. Within the declaration you have a property and a value.
                    <h3>Thinking About Cascading</h3>
                    A simple web page should contain two documents an HTML file and a CSS file. HTML uses the link element to indicate where the CSS file is located i.e
